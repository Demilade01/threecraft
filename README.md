# ThreeCraft

This is a Minecraft clone built using Three.js and TypeScript. It is a 3D sandbox game where players can explore, build, and destroy their own world made up of blocks.

🎬 **[Watch the Video Walkthrough](https://streamable.com/erzhin)** - See the game in action with Honeycomb Protocol integration!

You can play a demo [here](threecraft-steel.vercel.app/).

**Important**: It is suggested to play the game with Chrome, since it was developed and tested only it.

## Features

- Procedurally generated terrain
- Trees and foliage generation
- Caves and ores generation
- Basic player movement and collision detection
- World editing
- Inventory system
- Game saving system
- Sound Effects

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install on your local machine.

```bash
npm install
```

## Core Technologies

- Three.js: a lightweight 3D graphics library for creating WebGL applications.
- TypeScript: a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Vite: a web application bundler and development server.

## Known Issues

- Opening and closing the inventory without doing any action cause the camera to behave weirdly.
- Locking the mouse cursor fails if the unlock operation occurred in less than 1 second.
- Collision detection is not always accurate. Sometimes weird collision responses can occur when the player is moving around.
- Since the framerate is capped at 75, the game feels a bit choppy on higher framerate devices. (This is due the fact the draw calls are not interpolated between frames)

## Todo

Here are some important tasks and features that i'd like to implement in the future.

### Gameplay

- [ ] Block breaking animation
- [ ] Crafting system
- [ ] Visible arm/block selected
- [ ] Improve collision detection

### Environment

- [ ] Block lighting system
- [ ] Better sky
- [ ] Day/Night cycle
- [ ] Block color tint ( very useful for grass block )

### Codebase

- [ ] Implement ECS pattern
